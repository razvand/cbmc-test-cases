/* 2. Write a function that creates an array of a given length

/* 3. Write a sort function for an array of a given length.
 */

/* 4. Using the code from 1. and 2. create a verification harness and
 * prove that the output of the sort function is actually sorted.

/* 5. Is the output of 4. sufficient to prove the sort function
